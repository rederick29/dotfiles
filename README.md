<h1> Dots </h1>

Colour schemes I use: (and whether I'm still updating them)
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Arc-Horizon</td>
    <td>unmaintained</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Onedark Darker</td>
    <td>in-use</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gruvbox</td>
    <td>unmaintained</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Own colour scheme</td>
    <td>unmaintained</td>
  </tr>
</table>
Each one of them has its own branch.

waybar dotfiles are based off [begs' dotfiles](https://git.sr.ht/~begs/dotfiles/tree/1c92a56187a56c8531f04dea17c5f96acd9e49c4/item/.config/waybar)

I don't own the colour schemes, I have only adapted them to my dotfiles.
